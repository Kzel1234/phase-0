What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?

The 6 phases of web design are: Information gathering, Planning, Design, Development, Testing and Delivery, Maintenance

What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?

My site's primary goal is to display my projects, and will feature said projects and some information about myself.

What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

My target audience's interests should be in web development. I see my site addressing my audience by
providing my portfolio for them to observe.

What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for
information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

The primary action the user should take when coming to my website is to obseve the projects in my portfolio.

What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?

In my opinion, the most important part about the design and UX of a website is that they fit the needs of the users.

What is user experience design and why is it valuable?

UX is the feeling users get when interfacing with a website or software. It is valuable because a poor UX could cause users to not use your website or software, and use one that is better suited for them.

Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

I've never been to much of a planner. Being a musician, improvisation and learning while doing is something that has been ingrained in me, so I found the site map building to be somewhat tedious.
