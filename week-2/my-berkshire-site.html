<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
It was really awesome to see my code turn into a functional website. I am interested in knowing more about how HTML works.
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
I was a little confused as far as the new stuff in HTML5 as opposed to HTML4
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
I think we did very well.
- What seems good and bad about HTML?
The only bad part of HTML is keeping the code from becoming hard to follow, but I love the creative aspect of HTML
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
I usually add both an opening and closing tag before putting anything inbetween them.
