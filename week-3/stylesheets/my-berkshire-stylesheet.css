/*
What is important to know when linking an external file (like a stylesheet) to an HTML file?
It is super impirtant to know the name of, and correct file path of the file you are trying to link to.

What tricks did you use to help you with positioning? How hard was it to get the site as you wanted it?
It was really frustrating to get the site the way we wanted it. We tried a bunch of different tricks such as using float, margin, and padding, some which worked and some which did not.

What CSS did you use to modify the element style (like size, color, etc.)
We used color, font-color, font-size, font-weight, background-color, and a ton of postioning.

Did you modify the HTML to include classes or ids? If so, which did you choose and why? If you didn't, how would you know which one to add to your HTML?
We used multiple classes and IDs in out HTML for different purposes.

When you compared your site to the actual code base, which do you think had cleaner code that followed best practices and why?
Certainly the actual website had cleaner code, but the actual website was probably built in more than 2 hours, by someone who had previous experience with CSS.
