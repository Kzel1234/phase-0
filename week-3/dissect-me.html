<!--
What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
I often use the new html5 tags such as nav, aside, header, and footer because they make my code easier to read, and navigate through.

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
Elements naturally go to the top left, and can be positioned using CSS. Browsers display elements from top to bottom.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
I didn't even know snippets were a thing before this challenege. I plan on researching more of them to make my coding experience easier.
