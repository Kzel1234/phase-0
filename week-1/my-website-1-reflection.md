Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
To create a repository, all you have to do is go to your profile on GitHub, click on the "repositories" tab, and click on the green button that says "New". To clone the repository to your computer, simply copy the url on your repository's page, make sure you are in the directory you want to clone it to, and use the command "git clone (YOUR URL)".

Describe what open source means.
Open source content is content where the source code is available for those to change. It allows people to take a program, or someone elses code, and change or add on to it.

What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
I enjoy the thought of open source material, but at the same time am worried about making sure all things I
don't want to make public stay private. I'm sure I will learn how to do this, so it is not a big concern, but I think that allowing others to make use of code that can benefit them, is good for the programming community as a whole.

Assess the importance of using licenses.
Licenses dictate what can be done with open source material. This is important if you want to apply limits to those using your open source content.

What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
Being completely honest, challenge 1.5 was a nightmare for me. After hours of work, I still couldn't quite get how to push to GitHub and make pull requests. During this challenge, it finally clicked, and I know understand just how easy using GitHub can be.
